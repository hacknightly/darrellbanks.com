-   Seamless tri-modal editor—text, sketch, and auto-generated quiz in one file that stays in sync (today you usually export→import).
-   Cite-as-you-go – auto-append source links so when you turn notes into a quiz you can click back to the exact paragraph or diagram that justified the answer.
-   Vertical packs – pre-loaded evaluation criteria for specific fields (med-school anatomy image quizzes, CFA-formula flashcards, etc.).
-   Knowledge graph view – auto-layout of concepts as you take notes; click a node → instantly generate a cloze deletion quiz or a mind-map image for slides.
