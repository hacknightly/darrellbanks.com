## Research Process {#research-process}

1.  Pick a topic (“Find claims that are important if true, and might be true.”)
2.  Read and/or discuss with others (a bit)
3.  Explain and defend my current, incredibly premature hypothesis, in
    writing
4.  Find and list weaknesses in my case
5.  Pick a subquestion and do more reading
6.  Reverse my claim / switch sides
7.  Repeat steps 3-6 as necessary
8.  Get feedback on draft and use this to keep repeating steps 3-6
