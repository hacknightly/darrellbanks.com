## How do you scale engineering teams and culture?

- Each component in a system shoulnd have a single, well-defined
  responsibility and there should be minimal dependency between other
  components in the system.

- Communication acrorss teams should have low bandwidth, anb be limited
  to when the teams are working on new ideas or building proof of
  concepts, as that requires a collective and broader outlook towards
  solving problems.

- High-performing engineering teams are built on \"services for teams\"
  not \"teams for services\". Every service or component should be owned
  by exactly one team. In the event that a service or component is
  shared between multiple teams, one of the teams should claim ownership
