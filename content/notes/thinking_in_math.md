I'm currently practicing mathematics recreationally, and can feel the
impact it's having on the way I approach problems in my day job as a
software engineer.

I came across an interesting article[1] which talks about how
programming languages help us represent problems, where mathematics
lets us reason about the problem itself, solve the problem, and then
choose an appropriate representation. Programming is for
implementation, mathematics is for theory.

As I meditate more on this, I'll be looking for more ways to
incorporate mathematical thinking into my problem solving approaches
at work.

I'm torturing myself for fun by revisiting math from the ground up, I
may as well find a practical use for the new knowledge.
