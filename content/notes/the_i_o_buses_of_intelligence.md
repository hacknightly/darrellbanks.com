## What are the inputs and outputs of intelligence? {#what-are-the-inputs-and-outputs-of-intelligence}

Ok, this question is a weird one, but I've been marinating on it for a
few days now. What are the inputs and outputs of intelligence? If I
were to quantify the things that an "intelligent" person were doing,
or the rate at which someone was gaining intelligence, what would they
be?

Some obvious answers came to mind; math, science, some sort of
academic pursuits. However, I wanted to boil it down to the essence of
those pursuits and what they entail, and that helped me to come up
with a very simple set of inputs and outputs.

**Word Input** - How much do you read? This is where we get new
ideas and perspectives that challenge our world view and force us to
think outside of our bubble.

**Word Output** - How often do you write? When we write our thoughts down, we solidify connections
between our mind and reality, and force ourselves to clear up the fog
of purely mental ideation. This practice helps create more clear,
focused thought, which contributes directly back to our ability to
learn new information.

**Challenge Input** - How often are you challenging your brain, and
learning new information? These "challenge inputs" are the broadest
bucket, and encompass any activity that we don't yet know, but are
learning. This is math, programming, puzzles, hobbies, and anything
else that forces you to spend dedicated time studying and storing new
information in your brain.

**Challenge Output** - How often are you practicing the challenge inputs?
If your challenge input is math, this is solving problems. If it's
programming, this is working on a side project that helps you learn a
new technique. It's not enough to have challenge inputs, you have to
put those inputs into practice to turn them into skills, which I think
is tangientially related to this pursuit of "intelligence".
