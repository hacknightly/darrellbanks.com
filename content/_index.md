# Hi! {#hi}

I'm [Darrell (duh-rell)](https:/darrellbanks.com/), and you have come across my publicly accessible
notes where I dump all of my thoughts for the world to see.

As this site reflects my fleeting notes, random thoughts and scribbles it is very likely to be a mess
and hard to navigate.

If you dare try and dig into my brain dump, feel free to start at the [full index](/posts/)

Have fun!
