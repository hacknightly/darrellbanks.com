# What is this? 

This is my personal notebook. It's a place where I keep track of my thoughts, ideas, and notes on things I'm learning. It's a living document that I update regularly. If you want to get to know me better, this is a good place to start.

# About Me 

🚶🏿 Just a laid back guy with a passion for building meaningful software and personal productivity! I'm probably in the middle of a Pomodoro right now! I'm deeply, intrinsically motivated by self-development and failing forward, so I'm looking forward to learning from my future mistakes.


## My Style

- 🚧 I live and die by the roadmap - I don't mind agility & flexibility, but having a well-defined mission with clear goals is my preference

- 🧠 I enjoy learning new things all the time - I hang out in Coursera - let's dive into some uncharted territory together!

- 👐 I like to dive into deep work, but am also always open to pairing & collaboration!


## My Values

- Transparency - I like to be 100% honest about life, work, and my feelings. WYSIWYG!

- Candor - Related to transparency, I like to tell it how it is and hope folks do the same w/ me.

- Self Development - I feel at my best when I know that I'm growing in my areas of interest, and helping my team do the same.

## How To Best Communicate With Me

- Come prepared! Having an agenda will help us both know what we expect from our collaboration.

- I can get a bit "philosophical" so please feel free to pull me back down to earth when my thoughts get lofty.

- I get excited about talking through ideas and might jump around a bit - please wrangle me!

## What People Misunderstand About Me

- I tend to have an overabundence of positivity, but that doesn't mean I'm not taking your feelings or situation seriously - I just like to smile!

## What I want to Improve on as a human being

- Listening. Sometimes I talk too much.

- Empathy. A decade of working in an industry with so much privilege can leave one feeling disconnected from the real problems in the world.

## Thank You

Thanks for taking the time to learn more about me as a human! I hope we get to work together on something amazing.
