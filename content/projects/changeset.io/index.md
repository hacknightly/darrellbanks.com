Changeset was born out of the frustration of having to manually review pull requests for every minor change in a project. It's a tool that helps busy engineering teams automate the rules around pull requests and code culture. It integrates with your existing tools and workflows to make the process of reviewing and managing pull requests as seamless as possible.
