The SCQA method is a framefork for structuring information. Using this framework, you can structure your
message in a clear, attractive, and narrative way.

The situation should provide a familiar, agreed upon starting point.
ex: Developers often find themeselves struggling with what to test when writing unit tests

The complication "sounds the alarm".
ex: As a result, software projects tend to have either incorrect testing assumptions, or worse, no tests at all!

The question creates the build up for the solution.
ex: How can we ensure that developers are testing the right things?

The answer drives home the solution
ex: By better understanding the testing pyramid and focusing on small, meaningful tests.
