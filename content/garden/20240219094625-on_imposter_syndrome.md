## NOTE On Imposter Syndrome <span class="tag"><span class="notes">notes</span></span> {#note-on-imposter-syndrome}

One of the psychologists who coined the term “impostor syndrome,” Pauline Rose Clance, has said that she regrets the
“syndrome” part of that phrase. “If I could do it all over again,”
she told an interviewer in 2015, “I would call it the impostor experience, because it’s not a syndrome or a complex or a mental illness.
It’s something almost everyone [goes through at some point].”
