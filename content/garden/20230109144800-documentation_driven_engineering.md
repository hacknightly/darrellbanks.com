It's an age-old addage that code should be self-documenting. But is that just
a well-intentioned urban myth?

There's a useful, if not overly-simple rule of thumb that I use when thinking about
the process of software engineering; Parts A, B, and C.

Part A is the process of information gathering, hypothesis forming, and perhaps most
importantly, writing it all down somewhere.

Part B is when I'm at my best. Writing code, wiring together software, and making things work.

Part C is after I've shipped my creation to users on the real internet, and the monitoring and
care required for support.

Admittedly, I find myself spending way more time in B than I ever do A or C, and I have a feeling
that I'm not alone.

This leads me to the greater point of this thought, which is that part A needs more attention.
The part where we've written down the problem and maybe even vocalized a few solutions before
any code is written.

In this part we're able to think about "why" we're building the things we're building, and
do some early solutionizing in a code-free environment.

I love using the [DACI](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/daci) model for very early, code-free solutionizing. It feels alot like
community brainstorming.

These early documents serve as the spring board for the real project documentation, and
help with communication to external stakeholders.
