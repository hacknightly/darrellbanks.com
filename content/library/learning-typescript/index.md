I found this book to be a wonderful overview of the language and a good look at its more esoteric features. While I was comfortable with Typescript before reading this book, I found that it greatly improved my understanding of the language and its features. It's a short enough read that it can be finished in a handful of days, but it's dense enough that it will take a while to fully digest. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to improve their understanding of Typescript.
