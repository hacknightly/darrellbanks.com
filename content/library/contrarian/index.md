Had this one sitting on my shelf for a while and finally decided to pick it up. I'm glad I did. There are several great examples of unconventional leadership that I found very interesting. Some of my favorite bulletpoints from the book were:

- Never make a decision today that can reasonably be put off to tomorrow.
- Don't form opinions if you don't have to. Think gray.
- Know the all important difference between being leader and doing leader.
- You can't copy your way to the top.
