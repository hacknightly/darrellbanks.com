The book "Tribal Leadership" talks at length about how language shapes
culture. It made me take a closer look at the language I use when
speaking to myself or my coworkers about our organization. I've tried
to be better about catching myself before saying things that might be
percieved as dismissive or needlessly pessimistic, even when I'm
having an "off day". Here are some of the words I'm using to try and
better shape the culture of language we use, which I think also
naturally reflects some of the things I value in a work setting.

-   Growth
-   Scale
-   Leadership
-   Pragmatism
-   Business case (money)
-   Transparency
-   Performance
-   Accessibility
-   Correctness
