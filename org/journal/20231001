 I finally got around to meditating today. It felt good to closen my eyes for a moment and focus on breathing. Hopefully I
 will be able to get a little streak going to keep the positive vibes flowing throughout the week.

 I plan to start a dopamine detox today to see what types of benefits it might bring. I'll be reducing/removing
 any social media usage, along with most other consumption-style activities. I'll also be trying to stop
 using THC cold turkey in order to ween myself into only eating the occasional edible for fun.
