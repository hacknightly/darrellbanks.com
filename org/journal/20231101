 Day 2 of the Dopamine detox, and I feel very strange. Energetic, but definitely ... off.
 I can feel my clarity of mind starting to come back, but I know this will be a tough
 few days.

 I was still up pretty late last night, meaning in one day it hasn't exactly cured my
 insomnia. That said, I felt tired sooner and that my sleep was better.

My grandmother passed away Yesterday. Not my biological grandmother, but my step-father's mother.
My step-father is a good man, and when I spoke to him, I could hear his hurt. He told me that
he didn't make it in time to be with her, and I can't begin to imagine how that must feel.

I find myself once again considering my own mortality, wondering how I can prepare myself for
the inevitable day that I get the call for one of my parents. Can anyone really prepare themselves
for that? I suspect not. What I do know is that death and I have a strange relationship in that
my own death is something I can reason about, whereas the thought of my mom or dad or wife or grandmother
dying send me into a deep anxiety.

I have other feelings on this day. Because of my birthday week, I have a trip scheduled with my
wife and son to go snowboarding, and it falls on the day of my grandmother's funeral. I'm trying
to convince myself that it's "what she would have wanted", even though I honestly don't know her
well enough to say that. But really I'm hurting for my step-dad. I want to be there for him, but
I honestly, selfishly have conflicting feelings. My mom said not to worry about it - I'm just thankful
that she's here to be able to tell me anything.
