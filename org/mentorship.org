* General Notes
** The best mentorships are two-way streets
*** Always feel free to reach out between meetings for reviews or catch up
*** What is an area you'd like to grow in over the next month? Lets focus on that 
**** What does it mean to be staff 
**** How to prepare yourself 
**** Ideas / techniques for buy-in 
***** Techniques that other people leverage to get it to work 
** Teach them how to recognize their skills vs knowledge. Seek knowledge, practice skills. 
** Evaluating progress: What criteria would help us determine how efficient our mentorship relationship is? 
** What might make this challenging for us? 
*** I'm relatively new to mentoring 
*** Our mentorship "framework" isn't well established 
*** Mentorship might be harder across products 
** As a mentor
*** Aim to learn something new
*** Help mentees come up with multiple solutions and articluate tradeoffs 
*** Tailor approach to technical vs non-technical problems 
*** A mentor is someone who has skills that a mentee desires to have and the time and willingness to help the mentee attain them. It's not really more complicated that. 
*** In some situations, we discuss what it takes to get to the next level in the person's career. Throughout the mentoring sessions, I try to spot opportunities to help them grow faster in their career
