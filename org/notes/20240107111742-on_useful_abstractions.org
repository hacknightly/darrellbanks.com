#+title: On Useful Abstractions

When writing software, it can be useful to consider what level of abstration you're operating
within. These are often concrete and related to the application at hand, like API, SDK, etc.
I found the referenced post to be interesting because it creates 3 layers of abstractions that
fit in all types of working environments; Nature, Middle, and Human. When writing code, I can think
of the 3 abstractions as follows.

- Nature: Computational efficiency (algorithms)
- Middle: Making the code readable for my team and myself (best practices)
- Human: Making it useful and delighful for humans to use (UX/UI)
