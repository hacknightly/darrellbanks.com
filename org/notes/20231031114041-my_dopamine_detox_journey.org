#+title: My Dopamine Detox Journey

I'd like to be more intentional about what I consume and when. The plan is to take a week off of:

- Junk Food
- Social media
- Video games
- YouTube
- THC

I'll keep a log of the ups and downs and, at the end of the week, reassess my values and consumption habits
