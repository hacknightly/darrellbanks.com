#+title: Why I Still Use Emacs

- tags :: [[id:723A6A25-72E4-4B7F-BA06-0FEC5F6DB19F][Engineering]] 

# The Beginning
It all began with ergonomics and a desire to keep my hands on the keyboard as much as possible

Started with Spacemacs which lit the torch and guided my way

# Why 
Emacs has become more than a text editor for me. It's a lifestyle.

The ability to combine my note taking, task management, and programming has been a game-changer. Less context switching.

More minimal when it comes to alerts, plugins, pop-ups, etc... Feels like working in Zen mode.
