* NOTE On Imposter Syndrome :notes: 
One of the psychologists who coined the term “impostor syndrome,” Pauline Rose Clance, has said that she regrets the
“syndrome” part of that phrase. “If I could do it all over again,”
she told an interviewer in 2015, “I would call it the impostor experience, because it’s not a syndrome or a complex or a mental illness.
It’s something almost everyone [goes through at some point].”
