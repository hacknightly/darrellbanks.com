* Good things
uh - I know that good things take time. I gotta find patience to wait
for'em

mamma gon pray for him, cuz though the sun shine in the day time,
when night falls demons'll take form.

and it's gettin dark out here,
want my soul to be free, but ain't no 106th and park out here.

I'm not gon hold it in me, I guess I need to get my thoughs out there,
