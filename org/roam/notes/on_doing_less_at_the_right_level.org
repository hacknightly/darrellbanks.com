𝐒𝐡𝐢𝐟𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐟𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐬: Spend more time on architecture, design reviews, and cross-team coordination instead of routine tickets. I stopped doing worker-bee tickets; now I design and build systems that scale.

𝐃𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐥𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞: Keep a brief log of design decisions, trade-offs, and measurable impacts to use in reviews or when marketing your services.

𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩 𝐧𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐬𝐤𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐬: Practice presenting trade-offs to product and leadership, negotiating priorities, and planting ideas with stakeholders so they adopt them as their own.

𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐥𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞: Build reusable patterns, libraries, and standards that reduce repetitive work and increase your visibility. Use generative AI to accelerate creation of these assets, not to replace them.

𝐌𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐞: Teach teammates to execute and use generative AI to produce clear specs, acceptance criteria, and example implementations so they can deliver without handholding.

𝐁𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲: Run architecture reviews, present designs, and brief stakeholders regularly so your influence is obvious and credited.
