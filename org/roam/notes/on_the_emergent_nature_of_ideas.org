I recently read an article titled "How to live an intellectually rich
life" which touched on the topic of Conway's game of life and how it
can be an analogy for how we fill our lives with ideas.

If we have too few ideas, they die, similar to the cells in the game
of life. However, if we have too many ideas of the same kind, we just
recycle through the ideas, essentially becoming the oscillators of the
game of life.

In short - our ideas need to be diverse, abundant, and documented in a way that's
accessible for us, not others.
