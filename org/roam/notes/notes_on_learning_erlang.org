*Connections*: [[id:4868E6CD-1173-4A61-92AF-3FBF7CD06EE0][Erlang]] 

* Starting Out

** The Shell 

*** Start with *erl*

*** User switch command is ^G

** Variables 

*** Must start with an uppercase (because atoms are lowercase) 

*** Operate on pattern matching under the hood 

**** ie One = 1. One = 2 + 1.
> exception error: no match of right hand side value 3

** Atoms

*** Must start with a lowercase (because variables are uppercase) 

*** Can be enclosed in single quotes if not starting with an uppercase, or if it contains other alphanumeric characters other than _ or @.

*** Should never be generated dynamically, as they aren't garbage collected and will pile up in memory.

** Boolean Algebra and Comparison Operators

*** true, false, and, or, xor, not

*** 5 *=:=* 5 -> true

*** 1 *=*:= 0 -> false

*** 1 *=/=* 0 -> true

*** 5 *=:=* 5.0 -> false

*** 5 == 5.0 -> true

*** 5 /= 5.0 -> false

** Tuples

*** PreciseTemperature = {celsius, 23.212}.

** Lists

*** Can store multiple types

**** [1, 2, 3, {numbers, [4,5,6]}, 5.34, atom].

*** Watch out! Strings are lists of numbers

**** [97, 98, 99] -> "abc" 

**** Erlang will print lists of numbers as numbers only when at least one of them could not also represent a letter

*** List concatenation is done with *++*

**** [1,2] ++ [3,4] = [1, 2, 3, 4]

*** List removal is done with *--*

**** [1,2,3,4] -- [3,4] -> [1,2] 

*** List Comprehension

**** [2*N || N <- [1,2,3,4]] 

** Modules

*** Modules are declared with the *-module(<name>)* syntax
