* Research Process
1. Pick a topic (“Find claims that are important if true, and might be true.”)
2. Read and/or discuss with others (a bit)
3. Explain and defend my current, incredibly premature hypothesis, in
   writing
4. Find and list weaknesses in my case
5. Pick a subquestion and do more reading
6. Reverse my claim / switch sides
7. Repeat steps 3-6 as necessary
8. Get feedback on draft and use this to keep repeating steps 3-6

* Topics / Hypothesis

** [ ] In five years, web browsers will be dead. The web will be
something an AI agent uses on your behalf
