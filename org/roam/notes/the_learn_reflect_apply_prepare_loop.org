The LRAP loop is a system for learning and growth that uses
the four steps as a continuous loop of improvement.

* Learn: Learn something new every day
- What new idea or perspective did I encounter today? 

* Reflect: Reflect and write to think more clearly
- What does today's learning mean for me? 

* Apply: Apply what you know
- Did I do anything to make use of the knowledge I have generated?

* Prepare: Prepare for the future
- What did I do today that tomorrow me will thank me for?
