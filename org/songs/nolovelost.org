* No love lost
you go your way I'll go mine,
just have peace with what you find / guess I - shoulda - seen the - signs
say you hate me one more time.
but that's fine, cuz there's
no love lost at all,
there's no love lost.
no love lost at all,
there's no love lost.

remember when I thought you was the one for me,
break my heart and soul and that's all you've done for me,
I took my problems and I would run to you.
Live your best life though, that's all I want for you,
I gotta make my soul better,
momma told me "you know better",
boy you gon find ten times outta ten,
nothing is fo-eva.
