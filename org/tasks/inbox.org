**** NOTE Type Level Typescript :learning: 
+ TypeScript provides us with 5 main categories of types: primitive types, literal types, data structure types,
  union types, and intersection types.
+ To get a better grasp of unions and intersections types, I'll need to cover a notion that's fundamental to Type-level TypeScript:
  all types are sets. 
+ "unknown" is the topmost superset to which all other types/sets belong
+ "never" is the empty, bottom-level set, for example when trying to intersect `string` and `number`
+ Records like {[key: string]: boolean} can be created using the built-in Record generic: Record<string, boolean>
