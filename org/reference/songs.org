They wanna see me fall off I can't do that,
I'm over gettin money where is you at?

everybody lookin surprised, but I knew that.

They say my shit cold,
I say, fa sho, tru that.

And I put that on my mom n nem.
Gotta keep the peace homie I know that's a homonym.

Well I mean it both ways cuz most days,
it's best to give me mo space,
foreal you better chill like O'shea.

I Ghostface killa beat till closed case,
this is not a close race,
you niggas is slow pace

And if I die tonight, fuck it, I was real.

I didn't pick this lane.
Got rich guess shit did change.
Some things don't though, I still spit this flame,
can't go, won't go - will lift this thing,
and make a man meet his maker, click click bang

just wish this game was more realistic,
wish I wasn't always chasing something in the distance,

wish that people saw these colors never made us different,
wish my brothers took a shot, even if they missed it

cuz this shit,
really here to divide us,
they just fear what's inside us,
gotta put it all aside and focus on the dollars.
they got us thinkin about this other shit that is not us.
we back in 1800 homie, just without the collars.

That's why I'm sayin fuck it swervin in this foreign bucket,
F and N passenger, I don't even tuck it.

I'm just lucky it's expensive so the law won't dare.
Tryna reach the stars and we almost there.
